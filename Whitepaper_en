# Whitepaper
This document describes the main points of development of the “OSC” project as well as details the sale of Onkostop tokens which will begin on February 01, 2018 at 00:00 EET and will end on April 1, 2018 at 00:00 EET
The “OSC” project collects funds for the official registration of a new innovative method of cancer treatment and introduction of the wave therapy device into practice.
## The Problem
The study of the oncological epidemiological situation in Ukraine showed that the incidence of malignant neoplasms over the last five years increased by 87% (according to the National Cancer Registry of Ukraine).
Only in 2015 there were 136,225 new cases of malignant neoplasm (MN), and the number of deaths from cancer this year was 66,017 persons.
An assessment of the status of oncological care showed that with an increase in the level of detection of patients at early stages to 53% and an increase in the coverage of special treatment for patients to 68%, the proportion of patients who did not live one year after diagnosis was still high and reached 30.5%, that is, every third patient dies within the first year.
It should also be noted that more than a third part of the patients with MN of the digestive organs and a half of the patients with MN of the respiratory organs received no special treatment, thereby, 50% of the patients lived less than a year after the diagnosis was established.
According to the statistics of the National Cancer Institute, about 1,000,000 patients are currently registered in oncology institutions of Ukraine.
Each ill person as well as her family and friends after the official diagnosis are faced with the problem of choosing an effective treatment and its high cost.
The Solution
We created and developed a new method of therapeutic effect on malignant neoplasms – the wave therapy. “OSC” (from English word oscillator — the generator of oscillating, heterodyne, radiator, vibrator) is a new and innovative project in the field of medicine of a group of Kiev scientists and enthusiasts, graduates of NTUU KPI who, working on a project about renewable energy based on Nikola Tesla's works revealed a number of interesting and specific effects of electromagnetic waves on pathology in the organism.
During the following years, after having studied the obtained results, we created and developed a portable wave therapy device that allows the local application of electromagnetic fields on the affected parts of the body. Wave therapy, being a new cancer treatment method, was applied to more than 42 patients with oncology illnesses of different stages and species. Among them, in 92% of cases, our new cancer treatment method has yielded positive results: complete tumor regression, significant decrease of MN, destruction of secondary formations (metastasis), tumor growth stopping and stabilizing of the condition. Our wave therapy device is the latest development, which has no analogues.
Tasks of the Project
It is necessary to register and get a certificate for a medical device — wave therapy device OSC-M.
For this it is necessary to go through the following steps.
1. Conduct preclinical tests of the device:
terms — 12 months;
the necessary financing — $ 360,000.
Conducting preclinical experiments on the basis of the Institute of Experimental Pathology, Oncology and Radiobiology named after R. E. Kavetsky of National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Kiev.
2. Carrying out of clinical tests of the device (on all kinds of cancer):
terms — 12–36 months;
necessary financing — the amount is specified.
It is planned to conduct clinical experiments on the basis of the National Cancer Institute of Ukraine, Kiev.
3. Registration of the device in the Ministry of Health of Ukraine and obtaining a certificate for a medical device for the treatment and prevention of oncological diseases:
terms — 6–12 months;
necessary financing — the amount is specified.
Cost Estimates for Scientific Researches
1. Scientific (preclinical) researches will be conducted at the Institute of Experimental Pathology, Oncology and Radiobiology named after R. E. Kavetsky.
It is planned to conduct scientific studies of the effect of the OSC device on tumor cells in systems in vitro and in vivo.
The researches will be carried out in cooperation with the structural units of the Institute of Experimental Pathology, Oncology and Radiobiology named after R. E. Kavetsky, specifically:
Department of Molecular and Cellular Pathobiology. Head of the department — correspondent member of NAS of Ukraine S. P. Sidorenko.
Laboratory of Model Systems of Experimental Oncology. Head of the laboratory — doctor of biological sciences, professor Y. I. Kudryavets.
Department of Oncohematology. Head of the department — doctor of biological sciences, professor D. F. Gluzman.
Department of Tumor Biochemistry and Oncopharmacology. Head of the department — doctor of biological sciences, senior researcher S. P. Zaletok.
Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Metastasis. Head of the laboratory — doctor of phys.-math. sciences, professor G. I. Solyanik.
Department of Monitoring of Tumor Process and Therapy Design. Head of the department — academician of NAS of Ukraine V. F. Chekhun.
Laboratory of Genetics of Cancer. Head of the laboratory — doctor of biological sciences, senior researcher L. G. Buchinskaya.
Laboratory of Metastatic Microenvironment Problems. Head of the Laboratory — candidate of biological sciences, senior researcher I. I. Ganusevich.
Department of Biological Effects of Lonizing and Non-Ionizing Radiation. Deputy head of the department — doctor of biological sciences, senior researcher E. A. Domina.
Department of Means and Methods of Sorption Therapy. Head of the department — correspondent member of NAS of Ukraine V. Nikolaev.
Terms of scientific researches — 12 months.
The required funding is $ 235,000.
2. Technical costs.
For comprehensive scientific research, an equipment that will give an opportunity to simulate and generate a high-quality signal from the device, to control, quickly and qualitatively adjust the device and the remote emitter is needed.
Necessary equipment:
Digital oscilloscope. The cost is $ 8 600.
Universal signal generator. The cost is $ 10,900.
Consumables for two devices — $ 8 500.
The total cost will compound $ 28,000.
3. Provision the work of project staff.
The total number of employees compounds 3 persons.
Salary for each employee is $ 1,500 per month.
The total fund of salary for the whole year of work is $ 54,000.
4. Organizational costs. (consumables, additional hardware inspections, unforeseen costs, force majeure events)
The planned budget for 12 months is $ 43,000.
The total cost of researches for 12 months is $ 360,000.
Onkostop Token
Onkostop tokens (OSC) are a unit of accounting that is used to represent the digital balance in fundraising for preclinical testing of a wave therapy device.
The minimal fund is $ 360,000.
The minimal investment amount is 0.1 Ethereum (ETH) + commission.
The initial equivalent of 1 Onkostop token (OSC) = 0.1 Ethereum (ETH).
The period of sale of the tokens is from February 1, 2018 to April 1, 2018 (2 months).
If during the sales period the project does not collect the required amount, the fundraising will be recognized by the organizers as unsuccessful and the owners of the tokens will be able to withdraw their investments back.
According to the legal nature the Onkostop token is the closest to the concept of a service contract that will be provided in the future, and is characterized as Utility token.
The rights of owners of Onkostop tokens consist of the ability to exchange them in the future for full treatment by a wave therapy device out of turn or the transfer of this right at their own decision.
It should also be noted that Onkostop tokens are intended primarily for use within the OSC project.
The token buyer uses Onkostop tokens outside the system in which they are located only on his own initiative, as well as in other ways.
Purchase of Onkostop tokens today will allow you to receive qualitative and effective treatment of oncological diseases at a relatively low price in the future.
