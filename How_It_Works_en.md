# About Technology
## Wave Therapy Is a New Method of Cancer Treatment
Graduates of the NTUU KPI during the experiments with renewable energy (Nikola Tesla's generator) noticed a positive effect on the malignant tumor. A mobile wave therapy device was developed and assembled as well as a common methodology of application was developed after scientists have figured out which electromagnetic radiation gave such a positive effect. As a consequence, it was possible to achieve good results in the treatment of benign and malignant neoplasms at different stages of their manifestations.
## The Essence of the Method
A set of properly selected and assembled electromagnetic waves can destroy the signals of transduction of cancer cells and, as a consequence, run the apoptosis of the cell. Also, thanks to the additional number of frequencies, included in the set of wave therapy, cells receive an additional charge from the outside that positively affects the general state of health and vital activity of the organism, additionally helping in to fight against various pathologies. The device of wave therapy is the apparatus itself and a set of replaceable radiators.
The device in itself contains generators of wave oscillations, operating in the range of 8–450 MHz as well as a power supply, control and management system. A set of replaceable radiators is a connected peripheral devices (antenna), which main function is to conveniently convey and direct a range of electromagnetic oscillations to a definite point. At the moment there is one type of wave therapy device — a mobile one.
## Wave Therapy Use
Wave therapy device should be used for prevention and treatment of benign and malignant neoplasms.
The course of treatment lasts 4 weeks, 20–22 sessions are conducted. One session lasts, depending on the number of tumors, 15–45 minutes. The number of courses depends on the condition of the patient and the type of oncology.
## Therapeutic Effect of Wave Therapy:
* complete regression of the tumor (depends on the size of the tumor);
* reduction of tumor mass;
* destruction of metastases;
* transformation of a malignant tumor into a benign (cystic fluid);
* longer duration of life of an oncological patient;
* prevention of precancerous diseases;
* activation of cellular immunity;
* improvement of the quality of human′s life.
## Advantages of the Wave Therapy
The main advantage of the wave therapy is the harmless effect on the human′s body!
Influence occurs exactly on the pathological cell, which is destroyed or transformed (from malignant into a benign cell). Thanks to it wave therapy device can qualitatively change the patient's condition within 3–4 weeks.
Changes in the patient's state during the course:
* temperature reduction and normalization;
* normalization of blood parameters (ESR, hemoglobin, lymphocytes, white blood cells, etc.);
* a healthy sleep appears and the psychoemotional condition is normalized;
* reduction of a tumor, destruction of metastases.

**It should be noted that the innovative wave therapy device can be used in parallel with the traditional medical methods treatment.
It will allow more effective treatment and, most importantly, effective and quick recovery after drug treatment.**
## Description of the OSC-m Device
The name – OSC-M wave therapy device.
Technical characteristics of the device:
* EMR frequency range – 24–240 MHz
* metal housing — dimensions: width — 230 mm, height — 100 mm, length — 310 mm;
* remote emitter, which consists of a cable, handle holder and emitter;
* system cable for connection to the system 220 V 50 Hz;
* output power — 10 Watts;
* weight — 3,5–4,6 kg.
## The device consists of three main modules:
